# Personal-Projects
These are projects I have completed outside of courses taken where I have practiced already learned code and attempted to learn new code. They will range from whatever takes my interest at the time - games, websites ETC.
I will updates this as and when I learn new things and upload completed bit's of work. They will be subfoldered by what I'm working on to keep this neat.
